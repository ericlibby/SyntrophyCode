# SyntrophyCode
code for publication

At the time of testing, the julia version is 0.6.0 and the Gurobi version is 8.0.0. The file "firstinstall" describes which julia packages to include. 

There are two scripts: 
"script_generatemetabolisms" generates a random metabolism through the MCMC method
"script_trademetabolisms" computes the growth rates for a pair of metabolisms in all 50 environments

There are three folders:
"Data_GenerateNewMetabolisms" has the necessary code for generating new metabolisms as well as also evaluating syntrophy
"Data_RandomMetabolisms" are the 1000 random metabolisms used for analysis in the paper
"SampleOutputFromScripts" contains some sample output produced from running each of the scripts

Additional codes or data are available upon request.
